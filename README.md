# LAPTOP-PRICE-PREDICTOR
Laptop Price Predictor
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of laptops based on various specifications using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a dataset containing multiple features like brand, RAM, processor type, storage, and more to accurately estimate the price of a laptop.

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted data types to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship between different features and laptop prices.

Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Training & Selection: Trained multiple machine learning models and selected the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Deployment: Deployed the model as a web application for easy user interaction.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Flask/Streamlit for web application deployment
